This is an unfinished chess project created by Mathias Langlet during 
a Java course at the swedish university KTH.

The intention for this project was to simply learn more about java. 
I thought it would be fun to create a game instead of making small 
booring code snippets that books usually tell you to.

A lot of functionality is not in place and I've not had time to 
complete it and might never do.

Feel free to add functionality for check, checkmate and castling.
